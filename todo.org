** DONE Error reporting from parsers                                :parsing:

   There should be an easy way to report parse errors, and they should be helpful.
** DONE Improve the run() interface                                     :API:

   It kinda sucks that you get this weird object that you have to grab .val
   from, and that you can't get all the results in an ambiguous parse from
   it. There's also no real point in exposing input to the outside, I don't
   think.
** DONE Port all the old parsers over to new API                    :parsing:

** TODO Publish to NPM and Bower                                       :meta:

** TODO Improve sequence error reporting                                :API:
   "whatever isn't a function. ohnoes!"
** TODO Write an 'expected' parser that spits out useful messages   :parsing:
** TODO Bring over all the important functions from Parsec          :parsing:
   Write mona equivalents for all the stuff that matters from Prim, Combinator,
   and Char. Not sure if I care enough to port over Perm. Maybe add a separate
   todo for that.
** TODO Support userState                                               :API:
** TODO Split mona up into multiple modules                             :API:
   Could still export all of mona from just the mona module, but it might be
   nicer for documentation and code organization if there's topic-based modules.
** TODO Bring back nondeterministic parsing                         :parsing:
