** TODO Improve the run() interface                                     :API:
   It kinda sucks that you get this weird object that you have to grab .val
   from, and that you can't get all the results in an ambiguous parse from
   it. There's also no real point in exposing input to the outside, I don't
   think.
** TODO Error reporting from parsers                                :parsing:
   There should be an easy way to report parse errors, and they should be helpful.
