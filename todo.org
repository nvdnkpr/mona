** DONE Error reporting from parsers                                :parsing:
   CLOSED: [2013-09-21 Sat 22:46]
   There should be an easy way to report parse errors, and they should be helpful.
** DONE Improve the run() interface                                     :API:
   CLOSED: [2013-09-21 Sat 22:46]
   It kinda sucks that you get this weird object that you have to grab .val
   from, and that you can't get all the results in an ambiguous parse from
   it. There's also no real point in exposing input to the outside, I don't
   think.
** DONE Port all the old parsers over to new API                    :parsing:

** TODO Fix the stupid parserFoo naming scheme                          :API:
** TODO Bring over all the important functions from Parsec          :parsing:
   Write mona equivalents for all the stuff that matters from Prim, Combinator,
   and Char. Not sure if I care enough to port over Perm. Maybe add a separate
   todo for that.

** TODO Bring back nondeterministic parsing                         :parsing:
