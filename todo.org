   There should be an easy way to report parse errors, and they should be helpful.

   It kinda sucks that you get this weird object that you have to grab .val
   from, and that you can't get all the results in an ambiguous parse from
   it. There's also no real point in exposing input to the outside, I don't
   think.

   CLOSED: [2013-09-23 Mon 00:59]
   Write mona equivalents for all the stuff that matters from Prim, Combinator,
   and Char. Not sure if I care enough to port over Perm. Maybe add a separate
   todo for that.

   I don't think any others are terribly critical right now. Bring them over
   piecemeal as more parsers get written.

   Problem solved... the way mona works with all the function definitions means
   that recursive parsers will blow the hell up. This also exposes the issue
   that we're creating way too many parsers and crapping up memory when we could
   probably completely avoid that if we handle these functions differently.

   For some reason, node just says Error when a parser error is thrown, even
   though it has a 'message' field, a name, and it inherits from Error. I'm not
   sure what else needs to be done!

   Support fast, buffered streamed parsing. Try and support at least node's
   async API, but see if promises can also be supported.

   Because of the way parsing works (potentially backtracking by a lot), it
   might be wise to make the streaming system support dividing the parse into
   separate chunks, with a callback to execute for each successful chunk
   received from the stream. The chunking parser would still keep track of the
   position in the stream and report it properly during errors.

   For example:
   var parser = parseAsync(csvLine(), function(err, line) {
     if (err) { console.error(err); } else { console.log("Got a csv line: ", line); }
   });
   var stream = fs.createReadStream(filename);
   stream.on("data", parser.data);
   stream.on("error", parser.error);
   stream.on("end", parser.done);

** DONE parseAsync handles should return the handle                     :API:
   CLOSED: [2013-09-24 Tue 18:10]
   Would make it nicer for chaining, and there's nothing else worth returning
   from these 'methods'.

** TODO times() parser                                                  :API:
   Applies a parser exactly N times and returns the results in an array.
** TODO breakpoint() combinator                                         :API:

   choice as to whether to break before, after, or both?

** TODO Split mona up into multiple modules                             :API:
   Could still export all of mona from just the mona module, but it might be
   nicer for documentation and code organization if there's topic-based modules.
** TODO Support userState                                               :API:
** TODO Make a note in the docs about recursive parsers                :docs:
   Instruct people to use either sequence or delay, or some similar
   construct. Might be good to just put this in a tutorial.

   This would be fairly impressive, so you could do:
   parseAsync(zipChunk(csvLine()), function(err, line) { ... }).data(....)
** TODO Write a 'make' target that will update the docs                :docs:
   It should probably really just be part of `make release`
** TODO Include a version in the 'mona' object                          :API:
   And modify make release to automatically update it.
** TODO Make the docs prettier                                         :docs:
** TODO Optimize!                                                   :parsing:
   The way things are done right now involves a LOT of consing, including a lot
   of unnecessary consing. Look into memoizing some of the built-in pure
   parsers for speed.
